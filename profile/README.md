# Maverick Mandir Initiative 

An attempt at articulating a possible answer to the question **"How education system would look like, if *youths/students* were the *primary stakeholder* of the system?"**

___


In private schooling the primary stakeholders are investors behind the institution. While in public schooling the primary stakeholders are teachers. In both scenarios, both are state sponsored education cum indoctrination. 

The issue is not because education is sponsored by the state bus rather because interest of the ruling elites of a specific state (city/ nation/ empire/ civilizational) usually doesn't align with the long term interest of state itself & because only the will of the ruling elites actually matters no matter what form of government is there.

Ruling elites naturally wants docile tax cattles that doesn't threaten their position nor question anything. So that's how Education (& Indoctrination) System is designed. As everything in given human society is downstream effect of parenting & education (+indoctrination).

> NOTE: I'm not using "Indoctrination" in a derogatory manner but rather, I'm referring to the "necessary conditioning required to prime citizens for socially acceptable behaviour"

For us nationalists, national interest is supreme. We need every citizens at their peak potential, that's the only recipe for a "Great Nation/ Civilization/ Empire state". So let's put "student" in the primary stakeholder seat, because that's the only way to produce competent leaders in governance, ideas & technologies.
